#Tell me a story...

*The somewhat intelligent interactive storytelling bot*

LD 35 Jam entry by David Cannon II, Joel Babbitt, and Simon Mikulcik

##How to play!

* Enter a sentence or two to start the story
* The bot will write another line based on what you say
* Then, you write another line
* You have control to tell the bot which path the story takes
* Use your words to shapeshift the progress of the story
* Hint: Be extra descriptive to make a more interesting story
* But! if you don't tell us enough information, we will use RANDOM words!

##How it works

We take the words you type in and find a bunch of words similar to them
Then we put the similar words together to create fun sentences

##Notable Technology Used

* Node for framework
* Natural for language processing for node
* wordpos part-of-speech utilities
